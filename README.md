# Hi there 👋, I'm Mulumbwa Matimelo
## Computer Scienctist (M-Steam)🔬💻📎

I'm a proud student of the University of KwaZulu Natal.
I do M-Stream, majoring into Computer Science, and I've done project such as game dev in Python, HTML and CSS websites, a bit of Django and I'm starting to learn more on development using Java. I'm passionate about tech, very friendly and quiet enthusiastic about development while learining new things in the go. 

## Skills 🖥️📱🎮: 
 JAVA / PYTHON / CSS / HTML

## Dreams and passions 🖥️📈📡
One day I aim to become a successful software architect and engineer, simply from the fact that I love the creation of advanced applications, their design structures and just the shear creativity behind them. I just love thinking out our the box for random solutions to a problem. I also hope to meet like minded people on the way that can help build paths towards success.
